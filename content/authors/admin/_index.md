I am a masters student at the University of Waterloo's Civil and Environmental Engineering department under the supervision of professor John Quilty. My research analyzes the joint usage of wavelet decomposition and machine learning for stream flow forecasting of snow-melt driven basins across Canada. I love meeting new people and learning about everything, feel free to message me!
